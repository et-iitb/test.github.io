            </li>
            <li>
              Interaction: Adaptation is done based on student actions and
              behaviours such as time spent on each question, skipping content,
              requesting hints/help, random clicking pattern for answering and
              so on.

          adaptation is seen and mark as not at all incorporated otherwise (0
          out of 3). It take time to observe adaptivity. Adaptivity based on
          interaction might not be easily apparent at the front end. Please
          consider your backend design as well, if needed, and provide rationale
          and evidence accordingly.
